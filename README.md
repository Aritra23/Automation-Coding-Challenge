# Automation-Coding-Challenge - Finding length and longest words in a sentence

Assumptions: 
a) If there are two or more words with largest length, then the word that occurs first in the sentence is returned.
b) It is assumed that the sentence is only space delimited, other delimiters are not considered in scope.
c) It is assumed that sentence can contain alphanumeric characters as part of the string and they are considered for calculating the longest word length


How to use:

I have included a main method in the class file as well for testing the code with varying inputs.

Also Unit Tests have been added in a separate Test folder for testing the longest Word length method.

Steps:
1) Clone the repository and add it in your own workspace.
2) Compile using the command : javac src/com/java/challenge/FindLongestWord.java test/com/junit/test/FindLongestWordTest.java
3) To execute the Unit Tests Run the command: java test/com/junit/test/FindLongestWordTest.java

This will execute all the test cases added in the 'FindLongestWordTest' Class.
